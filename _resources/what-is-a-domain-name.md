A domain name is a unique and memorable way for someone to access your website. When computers talk to each other they use something called an **IP Address** which is a series of numbers and periods to identify each other.

However, this is not easy for a person to remember and so domain names are used instead. For example, when you wish to go to Google you use [https://google.co.uk](https://google.co.uk) which the computer translates into 216.58.206.67 (for example).

A domain name has to be unique, no one else will ever have the same one as you. They are made up of numbers and letters and can end in many different domain name extensions, such as .co.uk, .com and .net.

Domain names must be purchased and registered before being used. They can be purchased from several places on the internet, such as:

1. [LCN](https://lcn.com)
2. [123-reg](https://123-reg.co.uk/)
3. [Names](https://www.names.co.uk/domain-names)
