# What is the internet?

The internet is built upon the concepts of wide area networking spearheaded by several computer science laborities around the world and the work on the **ARPANET project** funded by the U.S. Department of Defense in the 1960's.

In its current iteration the internet is made up of millions of computers all over the world that are connected together using cables, switches and routers allowing you to share and access information, images and video files in milliseconds.

# Packets

The easiest way to imagine the internet is to think of sending letters between yourself and a friend. You may not have a full understanding of how the postal system works but there is a whole infrastructure in the background that sorts, transports and ensures your letter arrives in your friends possession. A letter can pass through multiple people before its journey is complete as well as use a variety of different methods of transport such as cars, lorries, planes and boats.

With the internet the letters are replaced with **packets**, the transport network with **cables** and the sorting offices with **routers**.

## What is a packet?

A packet is a bundle of data that is passed around when a **request** is made, such as a search on Google, post to Facebook or sharing a video on Whatsapp, between computers to instruct them who should get this request.
