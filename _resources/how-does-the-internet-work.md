## What is the internet?

The internet is built upon the concepts of wide area networking spearheaded by several computer science laborities around the world and the work on the **ARPANET project** funded by the U.S. Department of Defense in the 1960's.

In its current iteration the internet is made up of millions of computers all over the world that are connected together using cables, switches and routers allowing you to share and access information, images and video files in milliseconds.

## Introducing packets

The easiest way to imagine the internet is to think of sending letters between yourself and a friend. You may not have a full understanding of how the postal system works but there is a whole infrastructure in the background that sorts, transports and ensures your letter arrives in your friends possession. A letter can pass through multiple people before its journey is complete as well as use a variety of different methods of transport such as cars, lorries, planes and boats.

With the internet the letters are replaced with **packets**, the transport network with **cables** and the sorting offices with **routers**.

## What is a packet?

A packet is a bundle of data that is passed around when a **request** is made, such as a search on Google, post to Facebook or sharing a video on Whatsapp, between computers to instruct them who should get this request.

### Send a request

Among the bundle of data a lot of important information is stored including the address of the sender's computer and the address of the requested web server. Using this information the packet is passed through the internet via routers and switches until it arrives at the correct server.

### Return information

Now the packet is with the server it is able to request the information it was sent to retrieve such as an image. The server will then send a packet of its own in response back to the sender's computer which will contain the requested image.

## What does this mean?

All of this happens in the blink of an eye, allowing information to flow quickly and freely over the internet.

Thanks to this amazing speed and accuracy the internet has become a key part of everything; even home appliances now communicate over the internet and lightbulbs can be controlled from your mobile phone.

The internet is always expanding as more and more people get connected and companies shift their business focus more towards ecommerce and online advertising.

## Some facts about internet traffic

Every second there is over 68,000GB of internet traffic. This is roughly equal to sending 13,926,400 high quality pictures every second.

Part of this traffic is made up of:

* Over 72,000 Google searches.
* Over 75,000 videos being watched on YouTube.
* Over 2,700,000 emails being sent.
